# NLPLibrary-GutenbergProcessing

This is a Natural Language Processing Library. 
The code (TextAnalyzer.py) takes a folder of text files, or alternative file formats if fed custom parser and creates several visualizations related to word occurences in each text.
The current parser takes files from gutenberg.org , and conducts analysis.
The visualizatons range from WordClouds, Sentiment BarChart, ScatterText html file, and Sankey Diagrams.
